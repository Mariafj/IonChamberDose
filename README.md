# IonChamberDose

Created by Maria F.J., 2019

A binary script (ESAPI 13.7) for calculating the field dose within a parallel plate ionisation chamber perpendicular to a proton beam.

The program can be used to calculate the dose in a ROOS ion chamber placed with the centre in (x,y,z) for a given field. 
The program calculated the field dose in Gy. Notice that the chamber is placed in the X-Y-plane. 

Use of this program is at one's own risk. We do not guarantee that the calculated dose is correct. 
The program must be validated and testes in different scenarios.

How to use the program:
Enter the chamber centre or use the coordinated from the position of a predefined marker.
Select a field
Press calculated
remember the water-equivalent thickness of the ROOS chamber is 1.3 mm.
The program writes which parameter is used to correct the field dose to Gy. 
If the parameter "Field Dose Normalization" is different from 100%, the calculated dose will probably not be correct. 
This will be changed at some point.
